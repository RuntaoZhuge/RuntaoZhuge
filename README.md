### Fun Fact About Pandas 🐼 (I love pandas)

Did you know that a newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter—about 1/900th the size of its mother—but can grow to up to 330 pounds as an adult? These bears are also great climbers and can start climbing trees at just six months old! I absolutely love pandas, not just because of their adorable appearance, but also for their resilience and strength, which I believe are characteristics every software engineer should embody.
